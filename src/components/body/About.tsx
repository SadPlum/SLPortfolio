          My name is <i>SÃ©bastien</i>, I'm a Front-End Developer with an
          unconventional background. I am a Journeyman Electrician turned
          developer. I'm bilingual (English/French), enjoy working on teams with
          unique individuals and thrive in an environment where I have to
          constantly learn and grow.

          I played around with programmable logic controllers (PLCs) in trade
          school and immediately fell in love with programming. I dabbled with
          Python, but quickly moved on to Front-End development. I reached out
          to Civic Tech Fredericton, joined their Meal Planner team and started
          to learn React.

          {/* Currently I work with semantic HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.JS, Sass
          and TypeScript. I am learning Node.JS and plan on learning some Python
          with a web framework such as Flask. */}
          My languages include React, HTML, CSS/SCSS, JavaScript/TypeScript and
          a bit of Node. I can consume APIs with React, and write them with
          Node. I also have some experience unit testing code in React. I am
          comfortable using Git, communicating, and understand agile software
          development principles.
